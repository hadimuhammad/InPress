We found out that there was a lack of interaction between instructors and students in the classroom. Due to this, it becomes hard for students to grasp and retain coursework later in the semester. Nowadays, 9 out of 10 students have an internet enabled device available to them during lectures. This motivation resulted in InPress being built. This web-based application allows students in various universities to respond to real-time questions posted by their professor using their computer or mobile device.
